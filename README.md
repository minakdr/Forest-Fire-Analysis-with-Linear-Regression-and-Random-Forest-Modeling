# Forest-Fire-Analysis-with-Linear-Regression-and-Random-Forest-Modeling
This project focuses on analyzing a forest fire dataset through exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling using both linear regression and random forest algorithms. The dataset includes details about forest fires such as spatial coordinates, month, day, weather conditions, and the area burned
